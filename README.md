# Influence-Maximization-Model
SI model for influence maximization, with data fetching and simulation of influence spreading.

Support Model for Influence Maximization on Temporal Network (Bachelor's Thesis).
Introduces:
-budget cap (arbitrairly chosen)
-dynamic node cost

Seeding strategies are already implemented and further ones can be added in the form of functions that accept budget and node list 
as a parameter and return a List representing the seed set.

Configurations are made through variables:
-budget
-dataset filename ('college.txt') is given as test purpose
-probability
-seeding strategy
