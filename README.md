Support Model for Influence Maximization on Temporal Network (Bachelor's Thesis).
Introduces:<br />
-budget cap (arbitrairly chosen)<br />
-dynamic node cost<br />

Seeding strategies are already implemented and further ones can be added in the form of functions that accept budget and node list 
as a parameter and return a List representing the seed set.

Configurations are made through variables:<br />
-budget<br />
-dataset filename ('college.txt') is given as test purpose<br />
-probability<br />
-seeding strategy<br />
